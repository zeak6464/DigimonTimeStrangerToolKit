"digimon_0002_profile","A Mammal Digimon resembling a rabbit, born from 
the fusion of moon observation data. Its large ears 
can recognize sounds from any distance. Although 
timid, Lunamon often gets lonely and easily grows 
attached to others. It uses its special move 
Tearing Shot to concentrate power into the antenna 
on its forehead to shoot a beautiful orb of water at 
the enemy."
"digimon_0003_profile","A Beast Man Digimon with astounding jumping 
capabilities that likes to toy with its foes using 
speedy movements. Lekismon's nature is as 
ephemeral as the phases of the moon, and its 
appearance is somewhat mystical. It uses its 
special move Moon Night Bomb to hurl hypnotic
water bubbles generated from the Moon Gloves 
on its hands and put the enemy to sleep."
"digimon_0005_profile","A Rock/Mineral Digimon discovered when 
performing digital analysis of an ancient curse. It 
has forbidden incantations in an archaic script
signifying ""plague,"" ""curse"" and ""evil"" inscribed on
its back, apparently meant to safeguard it from
the gas it emits. Approximately 90% of its body is
composed of rock data, and it survives by binding
up its limbs. An emotionless Digimon that doesn't
act unless so ordered."
"digimon_0009_profile","A mutant Machine Digimon shaped like a gear. 
There are also countless other gears built into its 
body that are constantly turning. If even one gear 
is removed, all of the others stop spinning and 
Hagurumon ceases to function. Hagurumon possesses
the ability to infect foes with a computer virus that
allows it to control them. Thus, Digimon of wicked
intent often seek to exploit Hagurumon's powers.
But since it lacks any sense of self, it has no way
of knowing it's being used for evil. Its special move
is Cog Crusher, which implants a black gear
loaded with a computer virus into its opponent's
body, causing them to go berserk."
"digimon_0010_profile","A Fire Digimon whose body is cloaked in crimson 
flames. Generated of the Firewall built to defend 
against illegal intrusions from the Internet, this 
Digimon has a violent temperament that reflects 
its blazing appearance and seeks to incinerate
anything it touches. Its flames burn more intensely 
than those of its kindred on File Island, making it
an extremely difficult Digimon to tame. But even if 
tamed, there's no telling when Meramon will turn 
on its master. Meramon uses its special move 
Burning Fist to cause its arms to flare up before 
punching its foe."
"digimon_0011_profile","A Mythical Beast Digimon with gigantic wings. 
Airdramon is an exceptionally valuable monster,
thought to be near in stature to a god. It specializes
in aerial combat, invoking storms with its roar and
creating colossal whirlwinds by flapping its wings.
Though quite vicious by nature, Airdramon is also
very intelligent. Nevertheless, any average Tamer
would find it nearly impossible to control. Airdramon
beats its huge wings to unleash a cutting vacuum
blade with its special move Spinning Needle."
"digimon_0012_profile","A wolf-like Beast Digimon with a pale silver pelt. 
Garurumon's fur is said to be as hard as the 
legendary rare metal Mithril, and the blades
extending from its shoulders are sharp enough to 
slice through anything they touch. Possessed of a
physique honed in the frozen tundra and a fierce 
instinct for conflict, Garurumon is feared by other 
Digimon for its predatory agility and unerring 
accuracy in bringing down its prey. However, it's 
also incredibly intelligent and steadfastly loyal to 
any it acknowledges as its leader. Garurumon uses 
its special move Fox Fire to breathe out a stream 
of intense blue flames."
"digimon_0013_profile","A Ghost Digimon with a cloth draped over it. 
Bakemon is a wicked being born of darkness, and 
is said to instantly destroy the systems of any 
computers it possesses. What lies beneath the 
cloth is a complete mystery, and there are theories 
that the shadow cast under its body is a black hole. 
Bakemon lacks combat power and thus prefers not 
to attack its foes directly. Its special move 
Death Charm casts a powerful curse. Those lacking 
strong mental fortitude die in a matter of seconds 
under its effect."
"digimon_0014_profile","A star-shaped Digimon discovered by chance in 
planetary analysis software at a space development
center. Starmon is a space warrior with stellar armor,
wearing gloves and boots emblazoned with stars. Its
tattered yellow scarf speaks to the many battles it's
survived, and its eyes burn with fighting spirit. Its
eyes can even be used in a more advanced manner
to hypnotize opponents. This hot-blooded Digimon
has a fierce admiration for the brave Leomon.
Starmon's special move Meteor Shower rains down
small meteors upon the heads of its foes."
"digimon_0015_profile","A Giant Bird Digimon with a pair of enormous horns 
on its head. Known as the ""Great Eagle of the Desert,""
Aquilamon soars through the sky at Mach speed and
can spot distant foes with its keen  eyesight. Its horns
display tremendous force when Aquilamon swoops
down to ram into enemies. While many Bird Digimon
are savagely brutal, Aquilamon values decorum and
obeys those it pledges allegiance to without fail.
It slams into foes from above with its special move
Glide Horn."
"digimon_0016_profile","A ""Commando Dragon"" that seeks to become a 
Virus Buster. While Strikedramon still has many 
vestiges of Monodramon, such as the horn jutting 
out of the back of its head, it has so transformed 
its appearance into a Commando-Mode Digimon 
covered in metal plating that it now resembles a 
completely different species. Despite being an 
inherently kindhearted Digimon, should it happen
upon a Virus-attribute type, Strikedramon becomes 
consumed by an instinct to exterminate and 
doesn't stop fighting until its opponent's data has 
been reduced to dust. It uses its special move 
Fang Strike to heat its metal plating to red-hot 
levels, turning itself into a mass of flame and 
tackling the opponent in a fearsome maneuver."
"digimon_0017_profile","A Dark Digimon possessing strong Dark Side 
Power. Minotarumon's movements are slow, but it 
has an extremely tough hide that leaves it unfazed 
by regular attacks. Its special move Darkside Quake
uses the Demon Arm attached to its left arm to
cause a massive earthquake. The attack sends
shockwaves over a wide area, making escape
impossible no matter how far enemies run."
"digimon_0020_profile","A mouse-like Digimon that's always filling Sukamon's
head with shady ideas. Chuumon has a solid
friendship with Sukamon (although perhaps
it's only Chuumon that sees things that way).
The relationship started when Chuumon was nearly
caught in a network system trap named ""Carnivore,""
only to be rescued by Sukamon, who just happened
to be passing by. Fundamentally a coward,
Chuumon is unrivaled in its slyness and takes
off like a shot at the slightest hint of danger. 
Its special move Cheese Bomb hurls a cheese-shaped
explosive. Anyone who makes the mistake of
eating one of these is in for a nasty surprise."
"digimon_0023_profile","A Mutant Digimon that DNA Digivolved from 
Stingmon and ExVeemon. A chimera of a dragon 
and an insect, this Digimon is known as the 
""Terrible Bee."" While Dinobeemon can't be easily 
classified as either a Dragon or an Insectoid type, 
its insect qualities are quite prominent. Flying 
through the air on its four wings, this Digimon 
tracks its foes unerringly with its compound eyes
before choking the life out of them with harsh 
certainty. Dinobeemon is also exceedingly
barbaric by nature. It uses its special move
Hell Masquerade to perform a ""dance of Hell,""
cutting through foes with movements fast
enough to leave afterimages. "
"digimon_0025_profile","An Android Digimon modeled after a feral Digimon 
with predatory instincts that enable it to reliably
bring down prey. Raptordramon boasts an incredibly
tough body as well as uncontrollable savagery, and
so it has been remodeled with pure Chrondigizoid
Metal of considerable weight to restrict its mobility.
Nevertheless, it still possesses exceptional explosive
power and flight capabilities, largely due to the feral
Digimon it used to be prior to remodeling.
Though small, Raptordramon is capable of taking
down even ultra-large Digimon in a single blow if
it can gradually unlock its abilities.
It performs its special move Ambush Crunch by
pouncing on the enemy and biting vitals with its
sharp fangs."
"digimon_0030_profile","Sangloupmon is a bloodsucking wolf Digimon with 
a noble demeanor. It's one of the oldest species of 
Digimon, said to have survived since the dawn of 
the Digital World. Digimon who have their blood 
sucked by Sangloupmon have all the data drained
from their DigiCores, causing them to perish, as 
they can no longer maintain vital functions. 
Sangloupmon is capable of teleporting to other 
locations instantly by disassembling its own data 
into packets and sending them across the Net. Its 
special move is Sticker Blade, which fires off a 
spray of thousands of minute blades to skewer 
opponents in the blink of an eye."
"digimon_0042_profile","An Insectoid Digimon affiliated with the mysterious
Royal Base, a secret floating honey base.
While its daily life may differ from that of other
Insectoid Digimon, FunBeemon has a cheery
disposition and is a hard worker of considerable
strength. It always gets along with Vegetation
Digimon like Palmon or Lillymon. The Royal Base
is under constant construction, and Funbeemon's
mission requires it to collect field data such as
flowers or plants a little at a time as building
materials. It's therefore classified as having the
Virus attribute. The base is also guarded by
powerful Digimon that prevent any from drawing
near, so the purpose of the construction remains
a mystery. FunBeemon's special move is Gear
Stinger, an attack that fires off a rapid volley of
tiny, serrated stingers."
"digimon_0043_profile","A Virus Gatomon with striking black fur. 
BlackGatomon is the quintessential child of evil, 
spendings its days wandering through eerie 
darkness. An extremely rare mutation of Gatomon, 
very few are thought to exist. BlackGatomon is
malicious and prideful and loves picking on the 
weak—all in all a problematic Digimon. As a Dark
Digimon, it generally Digivolves into a Dark Angel 
Digimon. Just like Gatomon, BlackGatomon's 
special move is Lightning Paw."
"digimon_0050_profile","A small, dinosaur-like Reptile Digimon that has 
developed the ability to walk on two legs. Since it
hasn't fully matured, it still lacks strength, but its 
fierce disposition makes it reckless. Hard, sharp 
claws grow from its hands and feet, and it makes 
full use of them in battle. Agumon shows much 
potential, promising Digivolution into a great and 
powerful Digimon. Its special move is Pepper 
Breath, spitting flames at its foes."
"digimon_0051_profile","An Android Digimon born from the fusion of the 
data from a portable music player and that of the 
mythical ""kappa"" river creature. Gawappamon is 
almost always cheerful as it listens to its favorite 
tunes, but it also sometimes weeps if the disc on 
top of its head gets scratched. It uses its special 
move DJ Shooter to spin its disc at high speed 
and launch it at the enemy."
"digimon_0052_profile","An Android Digimon that wears a shell like a computer
mouse. Kamemon uses its special move Pointer Arrow
to fire an arrow-shaped missile that it guides to strike
the enemy."
"digimon_0053_profile","A Holy Beast Digimon that's always wrapped around
a holy ammunition cartridge. Kudamon is constantly
building up holy power within the earring on its left 
ear, and the amount it accumulates affects the
course of its next Digivolution. Calm and collected 
by nature, it can assess any situation—even combat
—with accuracy, ensuring the advantage in battle. 
If things ever go south, though, Kudamon enters 
its cartridge to strengthen its defensive position.
Its special move Blinding Ray dazzles the enemy
with a glaring flash emitted from its earring."
"digimon_0054_profile","A unique Digimon thought to be a subspecies of
Greymon. GeoGreymon sports a deadlier frame

It can charge up a Mega Flame in its mouth to
maximize its destructive power and then unleash
it as a Mega Burst."
"digimon_0055_profile","A Beast Digimon thought to be a subspecies of
sharp-clawed Gazimon. Gaomon specializes in
hit-and-run attacks using agile movements. The
gloves on its hands are apparently to protect its
claws until they grow in properly. Gaomon uses
its powerful legs to spin and unleash its special
move Double Backhand."
"digimon_0056_profile","A Vegetation Digimon resembling a flower bud,
Lalamon drifts through the sky by rotating the
leaves on its head. Despite its lack of expression,
it has a great deal of charm. Its special move
Seed Blast shoots hard seeds from its mouth with
a surprising degree of accuracy."
"digimon_0058_profile","A Vegetation Digimon resembling a sunflower. 
Sunflowmon gets a real energy boost when it's 
exposed to sunlight, which makes its attacks more 
powerful. On sunny days, it may even fly around by 
flapping the two leaves growing from its back. Its
special move is Sunshine Beam, which releases 
a blast of sunlight from its petals."
"digimon_0068_profile","This Beast Digimon is the result of Gaomon's 
physique developing and the claws that were once 
protected by gloves finally growing in properly.
Although GaoGamon is a quadruped, its hind legs 
are strong enough for it to stand like a bear while 
it attacks. GaoGamon unleashes its special move
Spiral Blow to shoot a powerful vortex of wind 
from its mouth in one breath."
"digimon_0069_profile","An extremely rare Numemon that first discovered
the Platina Mine in the Digital World, taking in those
components to Digivolve. From that point on,
PlatinumNumemon's personality did a complete
about-face as it scraped together any jewelry data
it could find, decorating itself like a nouveau riche.
It's quite the ""gorgeous"" Digimon, despite its nature.
Outfitting itself with golden wings and jewelry grants
it considerable defense, but its attack power is
middling at best. PlatinumNumemon uses its special
move Platinum Excrement to hurl the dregs
(excrement) produced during the platina refinement
process in rapid succession. It also uses Platinum
Burp to release a putrid belch that saps the enemy's
fighting spirit."
"digimon_0070_profile","A slug-like Mollusk Digimon. Fond of damp, dark 
environments, Numemon lacks both offensive 
power and intelligence. Any Digimon can become
a Numemon if it isn't raised properly, but perhaps 
it has hidden depths? Then again, even its attacks
are bottom-tier, flinging its own poop to defend 
against enemies."
"digimon_0072_profile","This Beast Man Digimon is known as the 
""King of Beasts,"" and also the ""Noble Hero."" 
Standing out amidst the many savage Digimon 
out there, Leomon possesses both strength of will 
as well as a sense of justice, which it has wielded 
to defeat scores of villains. It has a rival in the
""Digimon Hunter"" Ogremon, which devotes itself 
entirely to acts of destruction. Leomon hones its
formidable physique with daily training so that 
it can withstand all attacks, and it kills foes with 
its ultimate technique, the special move Fist of

Shishiou-maru, the Beast Sword with a will of 
its own."
"digimon_0077_profile","A Digimon resembling a kamaitachi—a mythical 
weasel-like creature—with a blade for a tail. This 
tail moves with a will of its own, allowing Reppamon 
to handle even surprise attacks from the rear. That 
will doesn't always line up with Reppamon's, though, 
so this Digimon has been observed quarreling with 
its own tail during battle. Reppamon enjoys combat 
in wooded areas, making good use of its claws and 
tail to climb nimbly among the trees. Thus, one must 
exercise considerable caution when battling Reppamon
in wooded areas. Its special move Rolling Tackle is a
forward-rolling charge."
"digimon_0078_profile","A Dark Dragon Digimon known as the ""Deep 
Crimson Dragon."" Having Digivolved into a wilder, 
more ferocious creature, the childishness from 
its time as Guilmon is now gone. Although it's 
a Virus Digimon, Growlmon may become loyal 
depending on how its Tamer raises it, perhaps
even fighting for justice. Its roar is mighty enough 
to shake the ground, and Growlmon uses it as 
an aggressive display to intimidate the enemy
before battle. It has the special move Exhaust 
Flame, which unleashes a powerful blast of fire 
with an explosive roar."
"digimon_0081_profile","Impmon is a Rookie Digimon that looks like a devil
child. It loves to pull pranks, relishing the thought
of watching its victims struggle. Rumor has it that
whenever Impmon appears, electrical appliances
briefly go haywire, so if your screen ever shakes or
freezes, it might be because Impmon is pulling a
prank. But as much as Impmon delights in mischief
and malice, it's not one to meekly bow down before
the strong. It puts on a brave face and stands up to
them instead. Deep down, it's actually quite lonely.
Impmon's signature move is Summon, which calls
forth fire and ice elementals."
"digimon_0087_profile","An Angel Digimon with six shining wings and a
body clad in divine white cloth. This being of
absolute goodness is said to bring happiness.
Angemon remains utterly composed in the face
of evil, attacking relentlessly until its foe is
annihilated. Legend has it that Angemon has
often descended at the head of a host of other
Digimon of the same species when the Digital

who was lured to the Dark Side, was originally of
the same species. Angemon's special move is
Heaven's Knuckle, with which it pummels its foe

"digimon_0088_profile","A Holy Knight Digimon and member of the Royal 
Knights, Omnimon was fused from the Virus Busters
WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon through the

making it a capable and versatile fighter. Its
left arm is in the shape of WarGreymon, with
a sword and shield, and its right hand takes 
the shape of MetalGarurumon, equipped with 
a cannon and missiles. The cloak on its back 
deploys automatically when it needs to avoid
enemy attacks or to fly. Omnimon's special

and is inscribed on any Digimon with the ability to
cause serious damage to computer data. Still, if
used for the sake of peace, this ability could
potentially make this Digimon a guardian of the
Digital World. Guilmon can use its signature move
Rock Breaker to destroy even stone with its rugged
front claws."
"digimon_0091_profile","An extremely unusual Insectoid Digimon with a

hard exoskeleton and the simple movements
characteristic of Insectoid Digimon. Excelling 
as an assassin, it prides itself on attacks that 
target vitals with agile movements and precise 
judgment, silencing the enemy with a single 
strike. Stingmon possesses a calm, cool and 
highly intelligent personality. It uses its fearsome
special move Spiking Strike to skewer foes with 
the spikes on its arms."
"digimon_0092_profile","A Digimon brimming with curiosity who loves to 
pull pranks. Gatomon may be small, but it's still 
a rare Sacred Digimon whose appearance belies 
its true power. It wears its Holy Ring on its tail, 
proving that it's a Holy Digimon, although it will 
lose some of its power if it ever loses this ring. 
Besides the Holy Ring, to protect itself, Gatomon 
also wears gloves with long, sharp claws copied
from the data of SaberLeomon. Gatomon's 
special move Lightning Paw uses its claws to 
attack the opponent."
"digimon_0093_profile","A Dark Angel Digimon clothed in jet-black garb.
Devimon was once a radiant Digimon of the Angemon
species, but it became a Dark Angel when it fell into
the distorted space of the Digital World known as the
Dark Area. The prominent Mark of Evil on its chest is
proof of this. Though it has a cunning and malevolent
personality, Devimon is also extremely intelligent.
It's said that any who stare into its glowing red eyes fall
victim to its mind control and become subject to its
whims. Devimon's special move is Death Claw, which
uses its two extendable arms to pierce its opponent."
"digimon_0096_profile","A Mammal Digimon known for its large ears. Patamon
can use these to fly, but since it can only do so at
a little over 0.5 mph, its its walking speed is said
to be considerably faster. Even so, watching it
struggle to fly is an endearing sight, making it very
popular (although Patamon itself doesn't appreciate
such sentiment). Patamon is extremely obedient and
very good about doing what it's told. It can also use
its hidden holy power without a Holy Ring—a sign
that it's descended from an Ancient species of
Digimon. Patamon's special move is Air Shot, taking
a deep breath and then releasing a powerful blast
of air."
"digimon_0097_profile","A small Digimon resembling a bat. DemiDevimon
serves as a familiar to higher-level Digimon like
Devimon and Myotismon. Despite its low status,
it's rumored to have been responsible for tempting
Devimon, once an Angel Digimon, over to the
Dark Side. What DemiDevimon lacks in attack
power, it makes up for in malicious cunning,
and it's always causing trouble somewhere.
Fond of darkness and typically in the company
of higher-level Digimon, it's rare to see it by

which throws giant syringes at the enemy to
drain its blood."
"digimon_0100_profile","A brutal Beast Man Digimon formed when Lopmon
underwent Dark Digivolution due to anger and
hatred. Wendigomon isn't completely evil, and the
kindness it had as Lopmon still resides somewhere

this kindness, making Wendigomon devote itself
completely to destruction. In addition to its raw
power, Wendigomon has the ability to manipulate
time and space, and is able to warp by passing

develop its skills. Turuiemon is a practitioner of
Togaken, a fighting style of its own creation.
Its special move is Gauntlet Claw, which involves
a series of blows made with the Rabbit-Horned
Iron Claws on both hands. This combo attack
capitalizes on its rabbit-like agility and powerful
high leaps."
"digimon_0103_profile","A Crustacean Digimon that attached metal data that

dramatically increasing its combat capability.
Crabmon attacks with the giant blades on its left
pincer and the powerful grip of its right pincer.
For defense, it relies on its spiny shell to damage
attackers, and is utterly self-confident in battle.
Crabmon is fully aware of the weak points of its
joints and underbelly, and thus rarely leaves them
exposed. It enjoys trapping its opponents, and is
something of a prankster. Crabmon's special move
is Scissors Execution, which launches its sharp
left pincer right for its adversary's throat."
"digimon_0111_profile","A Digimon resembling a troublesome imp that
loves mischief. Crafty creatures devoid of courage,
Goblimon always move in groups, hiding in the

Mach speed."
"digimon_0112_profile","Because of the antiquated interface on its forehead,
this Beast Digimon is presumed to be an experimental

at anything and everything, though it apparently feels
a sense of attachment to something after biting it.
The strong life force data of the legendary ""dragon""

Coelamon's body composition is very primitive, 
with fins developed into limbs. Based on these 
facts, it's thought that primordial Digimon born

the fact that it used to operate mainly in the ocean 
area of a weather forecasting system. Its emotions 
are tempestuous, acting like a lovely young lady 
when in a good mood, and crying like a hysterical
baby when it gets upset. Lanamon uses few direct 
attacks in battle, relying instead on manipulated 
rain or other indirect methods of fighting. That 
being said, its battle strength swells during surges 
of emotion, with its combat prowess growing 
unfathomably strong when crying. Lanamon's 
special move is Rain Stream, which focuses 
torrential rain to crush the enemy."

combat. If it can't finish an opponent with its 
tentacles, Calmaramon withdraws into its mantle, 
increasing the power of its attacks as it takes on 
the form of a giant squid. This mantle is even more 
resilient than its tentacles, rendering external 
physical attacks against it harmless. Though 
Calmaramon is more accustomed to the seas and

demonstrates exceptional combat prowess when
fighting to protect something he cares about.
Aegiomon plays Attract Echo on his Syrinx to draw
the listener's attention, stealing its sense of self and
making it unable to see anything but Aegiomon as it
remains fixated on the tune. This gives other Digimon
the chance to escape or pursue said listener.
Aegiomon's special move is Stun Beat Blow, which
strikes the opponent and discharges the electricity
in Aegiomon's body through his arms, numbing the
enemy's nerves and rendering it unable to move."

its cool in any situation. Renamon's tall, slender
form stands out among Rookie Digimon, and it
prefers the speed of its many techniques over
power when it comes to fighting the enemy. Its
special move Diamond Storm hurls razor-sharp
wood chips at the enemy."
"digimon_0392_profile","A Larva Digimon with a timid, cowardly personality.
Wormmon is a descendant of the same ancient
species as Veemon, so it can perform a special
Armor Digivolution. Exceedingly weak on its own,
Wormmon stands little chance against larger
Digimon. But with the power of the Digi-Eggs, it
can Armor Digivolve and display incredible power.
Like a larva maturing into an adult, Wormmon will
one day Digivolve into a Champion of great might.
This Digimon is the very embodiment of future
potential. It uses its special move Sticky Net to
shoot viscous webs that bind the enemy."
"digimon_0393_profile","A Vegetation Digimon resembling a great withered 
tree. Made of normal wood, Woodmon catches 
Digimon that pass by and absorbs their energy to
survive. It can also use its root-like limbs to move. 
Brutal by nature, it attacks without rest when
angered. Woodmon's sturdy wooden trunk boasts 
high defense, but it's extremely weak against flame 
and particularly Fire Digimon such as Meramon 
and Birdramon. It uses its special move Branch 
Drain to extend its branch-like appendages, pierce
the opponent and absorb its energy."
"digimon_0394_profile","A Digimon resembling an ""oni,"" an ogre of Japanese 
folklore. The attacks from Ogremon's frighteningly
well-developed muscles bring tremendous destructive
power to bear. Extremely intelligent but just as
temperamental, this rage-driven being wreaks all
the havoc it can. Belligerent to a fault, it will boldly
challenge even opponents with significantly higher
battle strength compared to its own, and this has
earned it the moniker of the ""Digimon Hunter.""
The bone club Ogremon wields in its right hand
was earned from defeating SkullGreymon in battle.
It unleashes its special move Pummel Whack by
swinging its massive arms."
"digimon_0395_profile","A Mysterious Beast Digimon in the shape of a giant
fox with nine tails. Kyubimon is feared as a beast
that brings destruction and decay, but in ancient
times it was hailed as a bringer of peace. A  Renamon
with particularly strong abilities and a wide range of
experience is said to Digivolve into a Kyubimon.
This Digimon lacks attack power, but possesses
incredible spiritual energy and specializes in spells.
The blue flames burning on its four limbs apparently
allow Kyubimon to gallop through the heavens.
Its signature move Fox Tail Inferno creates and
controls will-o'-the-wisps."
"digimon_0396_profile","A savage Beast Dragon Digimon possessing the 
temperament of both beast and dragon, this 
heavyweight creature makes most Digimon flee at 
the mere sight of its shadow. Dorugamon can be 
ferocious like a wild beast in battle, but the dragon 
intelligence at its disposal means it's usually quite 
docile. Because of the antiquated interface on its 
forehead, this Digimon is presumed to be the 
Digivolution of an experimental ""Prototype Digimon.""
Dorugamon uses the special move Power Metal
to shoot a large iron ball from its mouth and crush
its foe."
"digimon_0397_profile","A mythical Ancient Digimon that, even in the vast 
expanse of the Digital World, is said to have only
existed on the Folder Continent. Veedramon is 
extremely valuable to Digimon Tamers and rarely 
encountered, even on the Folder Continent. It's said
that only one Tamer has ever been able to win this 
Digimon over. Other than the V-shaped mark on its
chest, for which it's named, not much is known
about Veedramon or its surrounding ecosystem. It's 
sometimes mistaken for a dog for some reason. It
has extraordinary attacking power for a Champion
Digimon, exhibiting strength even outstripping that
of an Ultimate when the chips are down. It uses its
special move V-Nova Blast to shoot out a
high-temperature heat ray from its mouth."
"digimon_0398_profile","A guardian of time that governs computer timers. 
Clockmon manages all ""time"" and ""space"" on
computers and across the Net, and can move time
forward and backward freely between the years 
1900 and 1999. It always maintains a neutral 
stance due to this incredibly dangerous and
terrifying ability, refusing to take part in conflict 
between Vaccine and Virus Digimon. Many think 
that if Clockmon were to lean toward either side 
of this equilibrium, the Digital World itself would 
collapse. It uses its special move Chrono Breaker 
to destroy the very time that flows in the enemy's 
body."
"digimon_0399_profile","An Amphibian Digimon that mesmerizes those around
it with a cry altogether too pleasant for its strange
appearance. The chords Gekomon plays with the
three holes at the end of its tongue and the
improvisations created on the horn wrapped around
its neck can control its opponent's feelings. Rumor
has it that it's born when a hit song is created in
composition software, making Gekomon a kind of 
status symbol among musicians the world over. Its 
special move Symphony Crusher destroys the enemy's
insides with ultra-high frequency vibrations."
"digimon_0408_profile","A Dragon Man Digimon DNA Digivolved from an 
ExVeemon and a Stingmon. It retains many 
elements of Dragon types, with the power of a
dragon and the iron-wall defense of an insect's 
carapace. More than just powerful, Paildramon also 
uses quick and agile moves to finish off opponents. 
It's very loyal, and will unquestioningly lay down its 
life for its master. Paildramon uses its special move 
Death Parade Blaster to fire an energy wave from 
two biological cannons extending from its waist."
"digimon_0422_profile","Machinedramon, a Digimon made from the parts of 
countless Cyborg Digimon, possesses unimaginable
powers, and as such was apparently considered a

crimson metal body, is an even more advanced
version of Machinedramon. Its frame is made from 
Red Digizoid, a rare metal made by re-refining the 
virtual super-metal Chrondigizoid to increase its 
hardness. As a result, it's capable of repelling all 
manner of attacks, and destroying absolutely
anything. Its special move Hyper Infinity Cannon 
fires super-dreadnought class energy blasts from 
both of its cannons."
"digimon_0437_profile","A brand new type of Digimon. Three feelers grow

develop its instinct for conflict."
"digimon_0452_profile","A one-eyed Dragon Man Digimon with an abnormally 
developed right arm. Once a brawny dragon warrior, 
Cyclonemon had its right eye crushed by the warrior 
Leomon, transforming it into a demon of revenge. 
It strengthens and grows its arm larger in order to 
defeat Leomon, and hunts for a chance at retribution.
Shedding its pride as a warrior, Cyclonemon is now
a maddened combatant who thinks only of slaughter,
all for the sake of revenge. Its special move is
Hyper Heat, which melts any and all things."
"digimon_0454_profile","An Android Digimon that guards the mysterious Royal
Base, a secret floating honey base. The antennae 
on Waspmon's head have excellent scouting 
capabilities, and it constantly patrols in search of
Digimon approaching the base, attacking any who 
even draw near. The propellers on its shoulders and
stabilizer on its back let it move rapidly in all 
directions as it defends against approaching foes,
driving them off with its powerful laser cannon. 
Waspmon's special move is Turbo Stinger, which 
fires its large-caliber laser cannon in a rapid burst."
"digimon_0455_profile","A Crustacean Digimon formed when a Numemon is 
smart enough to search out a shell to protect itself. 
This makes ShellNumemon slightly more intelligent 
than Numemon, but also much more skittish, causing
it to flee into its shell at the slightest provocation.
Its defense increases dramatically while inside its
shell, allowing it to withstand kicks, stomps and the
like. Its special move is Mature Poop, by which it
hurls gobs of poop it's accumulated in its shell."
"digimon_0456_profile","A Mutant Digimon with a gun barrel for a body.
Though the particulars of its genesis are completely
unknown, Deputymon's sense of justice makes it an 
active member of the Virus Busters, special Digimon
among Vaccine-attribute types with the ability to
eradicate and delete the ""evil"" will of Virus Digimon. It
also loves gambling—especially Russian roulette—and
its fairness is beyond reproach, allowing even Virus 
Digimon to get away if they win at this game. 
Deputymon's special move is Justice Bullet, which 
transforms Deputymon itself into a gun that unleashes 
a justice-imbued round."
"digimon_0457_profile","Dracmon is the Dark Area's biggest prankster. It
won't hesitate to risk life and limb if that means
successfully pulling off a prank. One time, for
instance, it nearly died when it decided to try to
draw doodles on the faces of all Four Sovereign
Digimon (whether it succeeded or not is unclear).
While technically a vampiric Digimon, rumor has
it that lately it's been so absorbed in pulling a
prank on the Royal Knights that it's forgotten all
about drinking blood. It's also said that anyone
that looks directly into the Eye of Nightmares
cast from the evil eyes on its palms are subject
to its mind control."
"digimon_0458_profile","A Mini Dragon Digimon incapable of flight, despite
the bat-like wings on both arms. Monodramon's
personality is rather rough—bordering on brutal,
and it gives the impression of a Digimon that enjoys
a good scrap. It's often found in the middle of most
Digital World brawls, causing even the likes of Ogremon
to get fed up with its persistence. Monodramon's
special move is Knuckle Beater, charging into the
enemy with staggering force before unleashing
its powerful claws in a straightforward strike."
"digimon_0463_profile","A Vehicle-species Digimon similar to Mekanorimon, 
capable of leisurely flights through the sky. 
Blimpmon's soft balloon parts are protected by a

Its signature move is Zeppelin Explosion, where it
fires cannonballs from the two cannons on top."
"digimon_0466_profile","A Lesser Digimon that can run extremely fast, but 
only in a straight line. Dorimon hate to be tamed, so
many remain feral. Approaching it is dangerous, as 
it will charge in recklessly for a tackle. Dorimon's 
pointed ears are tough, acting as horns and inflicting
a modicum of damage when it tackles. That being 
said, it can't turn once it has gained enough speed. 
Dorimon's special move is Metal Drop, spitting metal
beads as it charges toward the enemy."
"digimon_0474_profile","A Dragon Man Digimon resembling a humanoid

Dinohyumon's special move is Lizard Dance, which 
employs dance-like movements to cleave through 
foes with Akinakes and the blades on its arms."
"digimon_0510_profile","A Bulb Digimon with a big flower blooming on its head.
Yokomon moves by deftly manipulating its root-like

"digimon_0512_profile","A Bulb Digimon with what appears to be a seedling
sprouting from its head. Tanemon Digivolved from a
Yuramon that landed on the ground after drifting 
through the air in search of the perfect environment.
Extremely skittish, it will use its four legs to quickly 
dig a hole so it can hide its body at the first sign of 
a threat. While Tanemon's body is hidden underground,
the seedling on its head makes it indistinguishable
from a plant, protecting it from harm. That being said,
this tactic proves ineffective against herbivorous
Digimon."
"digimon_0514_profile","Despite resembling an aquatic dinosaur infant, this 
playful Digimon can move as skillfully as a seahorse.
Bukamon is quick to flee when others draw near, 
however. Its skin still isn't fit for the high pressure

only spend limited amounts of time submerged in 
the deep."
"digimon_0515_profile","A small Digimon with feline traits. Fickle by nature,
Nyaromon has quite catlike behavior. While curious

However, not a single foe has ever been seen flinching
under this attack."
"digimon_0548_profile","A Mythical Beast Digimon based on mythical creatures 
of legend, with the wings of Pegasus and the horn of

trained, the Tamer can handle it with ease. Its special 
move is Holy Shot, which belches an energy bomb 
from its large mouth."
"digimon_0564_profile","A Mammal Digimon with a strong sense of curiosity

"digimon_0567_profile","A small Digimon that can perform low-altitude flight 
with the ear-like appendages on its head. Pagumon

down its enemy's eyelids or slapping their rear with
them mockingly. Particularly mean-spirited, it can 
often be seen teasing the likes of Koromon or
Tsunomon, chasing them around and around. 
Pagumon may even spit Poison Bubbles from its 
mouth to bully other Digimon."
"digimon_0569_profile","A Mammal Digimon with huge, sharp claws.
Gazimon is bipedal, an unusual trait for Mammal
types. The claws on its front limbs may have
developed while it used them like arms, causing
Gazimon to rely on its hind legs for ambulation.
Despite its small stature, this Digimon has an
exceedingly wild temperament, and never even
attempts to get along with humans. The claws
on Gazimon's forelimbs are extremely effective for
attacking, but are also surprisingly well-suited to
digging holes. Due to its mischievous nature, it
enjoys making pitfalls for other Digimon to fall
into. Gazimon's special move is Electric Stun Blast,
which belches out a poisonous gas."
"digimon_0573_profile","A Baby Bird Digimon Digivolved from samurai-related

Digivolution of Hyokomon will only happen when it
breaks out of its shell through endless sword training.
Its special move is Downward Cleave, utilizing its wings
and leg strength to jump up and swing its sword straight
down to split its foe in two."
"digimon_0574_profile","A Bird Man Digimon Digivolved through continuous
training with the sword. This led to acquiring mastery
over wielding two blades. Buraimon roams the
Digital World to continue its training and also
serves as a bodyguard, relying on its honed skills.
Seemingly willing to take on any job for a reward,
it's often treated as a thug. In reality, it's a gentle
soul that never takes a job that hurts the weak.
Buraimon's special move is Dual Swallow Reversal,
a cross slash performed quickly with two swords to
slice down a foe."
"digimon_0577_profile","A Goblimon whose duty it is to hear the will of the
gods and convey it to its clan. Shamamon conducts
a ritual in which it performs a strange dance, and

SnowGoblimon wears a warm hat and vest, so

"digimon_0580_profile","A species of Ogremon that lives in cold regions. 
Hyogamon is extremely territorial, flying off the handle

Mojyamon over territory). Its special move is Snow 
Punch, which unleashes a chilling blow."
"digimon_0582_profile","A larval Digimon whose epidermis has yet to
solidify due to it living underwater. Otamamon
swims through swamps and rivers upstream of the
Net Ocean using its large tail, occasionally
clambering onto rocks with its developed forelimbs
to do vocal exercises. Unlike those of an average
organism, its hind legs are almost completely
undeveloped, acting as rudders in the stead of its
propulsive tail. Unlike other Rookies, this Digimon's
future Digivolution seems quite promising, but it's
extremely prone to mutation, so caution is
warranted when raising it. Otamamon's special
move is Lullaby Bubble, which sends opponents

"digimon_0586_profile","A brutal Insectoid Digimon with massive wings. These 
wings allow Flymon to skirt through the air at ultrahigh

in its wake that rob unlucky victims of their hearing. 
Its body is protected by a tough carapace, and it 
pinches foes with its huge talons before killing them 
with the extra-potent venomous stinger on its tail. The
Digivolution process of Insectoid Digimon is still 
unknown, but from its face, some have surmised that
Flymon originally Digivolved from a Kunemon-type

over and over again."
"digimon_0590_profile","An Undead Digimon whose muscles have rotted off. 
Raremon tried to prolong its life by mechanizing itself, 
but the process was unstable, causing the data 
composing its body to start falling apart. Even so, its 
machine parts grant this creature life, preventing its 
death and allowing it to survive in this awful state.
This crumbling form affords neither attack power nor 
intelligence, making Raremon act according to instinct

In-Training Digimon running, and it won't fight

"digimon_0592_profile","A cursed Digimon in the shape of a spider, whose

though a Spider-species type, Dokugumon was
originally a gentle and quiet Insectoid Digimon. 
One day, however, it was caught in a powerful
electromagnetic storm, and was infected with a 
computer virus that had been lurking around the Net. 
From that moment on, it became one big lump of 
venom—in other words, a nasty computer virus, 
corroding everything it touched. Dokugumon's 
eight-legged mobility is worthy of special mention, 
too. Even if the enemy runs from it at full speed, this 
Digimon will be right on its heels, pursuing it until it 
tires itself out. And then, as soon as it stops to take a
rest, Dokugumon uses Venom Blast on it, unleashing 
a dreadful, venomous attack from its fiendish fangs."
"digimon_0594_profile","A Sea Animal Digimon with fins on its feet with which

Gizamon acts cowardly on land, but displays a
ferocious disposition once back in the water. Its
special move is Spiral Edge, which attacks foes with

handful when angered, rampaging like an erupting
volcano. The ore data Gotsumon uses for its armor
differs depending on where and how it was generated,
giving Gotsumon the potential to Digivolve into a

from its head."
"digimon_0597_profile","An experimental Digimon built in a laboratory as a

Snimon's arms are sharpened to points, allowing 
this Digimon to cleave cleanly through anything. It 
has no eyes, but the red feelers on its head act as

Snimon's special move is Shadow Sickle, which

Tuskmon has made countless Digimon fall before its

shark teeth and bring new horns from the back to the

senses danger, so none can approach without
caution. Even so, Kokuwamon lacks any aggression,
sporting instead an accommodating nature that

from its head that it uses to absorb nutrients through
photosynthesis. It has no way to defend itself aside 
from the hard shell covering its head, and its docile 
personality makes it an easy target. Kiwimon's special 
move is Pummel Peck, attacking with the ChibiKiwimon 
hidden in its body. The beaks of the ChibiKiwimon are 
just as hard as Kiwimon's, and they explode when 
struck. Even if this explosion chars them to a crisp,
ChibiKiwimon will always bounce back."

predators are around, or when in a good mood, it
will spread open the petals on its head and arms.
Floramon sees Palmon as a rival, and has a very
high opinion of itself. Its special move is Rain of

the Digimon controlling it can also be considered a
Virus Digimon. Mekanorimon is still in development,

"digimon_0631_profile","An In-Training Digimon that Digivolved beyond
Kuramon. The tips of its feelers are shaped like
talons, increasing its ferocity. Tsumemon corrodes 
data at frightening speed, causing networks to
malfunction. Its movement speed is just as fast,
making this Digimon difficult to catch once it's
Digivolved to this level. It uses its special move
Nail Scratch to rake the enemy with the talons on
its feelers."
"digimon_0682_profile","A ferocious Digimon with amazing vigor and extreme
aggression. Even so, it's friendly to allies, and those
recognized by Shoutmon can establish a deep bond
that transcends species. Because passion is the
source of its strength, Shoutmon won't abandon
a battle no matter how much damage it receives,
contributing to its savage reputation."
"digimon_0687_profile","A Mini Dragon Digimon with a cool white sheen.
Unfettered and hating shackles, Huckmon's
swashbuckling way of life is likely due to the
influence of Gankoomon's DNA. It faces the harsh
trials imposed by Gankoomon with composure.
Huckmon's lineage gives it a keen sense for battle,
and training supervised by the Sistermon siblings
makes it more than evenly matched in fights
against even Ultimate foes. Huckmon specializes
in nimble melee combat, using Fifth Rush to cleave
the opponent with its tough claws. It pursues its
dream to become a Royal Knight like Gankoomon."
"digimon_0697_profile","Zubamon is one of the Legend-Arms that can transform
its body into a weapon. The fabled Legend-Arms are
said to be capable of either saving the world in the
hands of an angel, or destroying it in the hands of a
devil. Zubamon possesses the data of the Twentiest,
and often shouts ""I am the Twentiest!"" without knowing
what that means. It dislikes anything warped or twisted,
and is in constant pursuit of its ideal of sharpness.
In battle and in jest, it's always trying to look sharp, and
days when it succeeds put it in a good mood. Though it
has its Twenty Dive attack that involves rushing headlong
at an enemy, Zubamon's true strength lies in its weapon
form."
"digimon_0698_profile","""I am the Twentiest! I won't stop! I'll keep on 
running!"" With those words emblazoned on its soul, 
Zubamon Digivolved to ZubaEagermon. Its new form 
perfectly embodies that spirit, and ZubaEagermon is 
committed to constantly forging ahead, over good
terrain and bad, even if it's reduced to a crawl. Its 
special move is Vantheon, with which it curls up into
a ball and spins, slicing through enemies with the 
blade on its tail. In its sword form, which it's quite
proud of, it cuts its way through any foe with all of
its strength."
"digimon_0701_profile","An enigmatic Digimon with a massive horn growing
from its head. While Terriermon's composition is 
enough to deem it a Beast Digimon, the form it
takes after Digivolving is still unknown. Rumor has
it that it's sometimes born with a twin. Terriermon's
extreme cuteness and calm behavior don't give the
impression that this Digimon is of the Combat Species.
Still, the power it exhibits in battle belies its
appearance. It uses its signature move Terrier Tornado
to spin both of its ears like a propeller, creating a
small tornado."
"digimon_0702_profile","A Bird Digimon with powerful legs that runs faster 
than it can fly. Peckmon uses its special move Kunai
Wing to hurl steel feathers it keeps under its wings."
"digimon_0705_profile","A Bird Digimon with more developed wings that
allow it to fly. In spite of this, Falcomon seems
obsessed with appearing from out of the sky riding
a giant kite like a ninja. Its special move is Ninja
Blade, which involves firing off cross-shaped
throwing stars made from its hardened feathers."
"digimon_0706_profile","A calm, collected and extremely courteous Bird
Digimon. Just like Veemon, it's a descendant of a
unique species that prospered in ancient times,
and can borrow the power of the Digi-Eggs for
armored pseudo-Digivolution. Hawkmon uses its
special move Feather Slash to throw the feather
ornament on its head like a boomerang."
"digimon_0707_profile","A Mammal Digimon clad head-to-toe in a sturdy
carapace. It is easy-going and courteous, but it
sometimes pushes its luck. Armadillomon is a
descendant of the same ancient species as
Veemon, so it can perform a special Armor
Digivolution. It uses its special move Diamond
Shell to launch its curled-up body at the
enemy."
"digimon_0708_profile","An unusual Digimon composed of blocks made from
a special plastic. ToyAgumon is said to be an imitation
of Agumon made by children playing on the
Internet. It's extremely cute. Unlike the bold and
fearless Agumon, ToyAgumon has a skittish side,
and its blocks fly apart when it's startled. Despite
this, it has a strong sense of justice that won't
allow for any sort of wrongdoing. It also adores
children, and loves to spend time interacting with
them on the Net. Its special move is Plastic Blaze.

a flame. It's surprisingly powerful."
"digimon_0709_profile","A Digimon shaped like a clam and surrounded by
a sturdy shell. Its highly developed shell protects
what looks like an In-Training Slime. This deceptive
Digimon uses its face to lure enemies in before
attacking them. Syakomon also boasts a high
defense when its shell is closed, repelling small
attacks with ease. Its special move Black Pearl
Blast fires jadeite formed in its body at the enemy."
"digimon_0710_profile","A Beast Man Digimon that is Digivolved from 
Terriermon, it's a special Hunter Digimon. Faster 
than its appearance suggests, Gargomon brings 
down its foes with unparalleled accuracy and 
precision. Its powerful legs let it jump high into 
the air, at which point it spreads its ears to glide. 
Cheerful by nature, Gargomon may lose control 
once angered. It's obsessed with its beloved 
""D-VI'S 503xx"" jeans. It uses its special move 
Dumdum Uppercut to get close to the enemy 
and thrust up from below with its Gatling Arm."
"digimon_0711_profile","An Armored Dragon Digimon completely sheathed 
in hardened skin. Tough protuberances cover it all 
over, giving its charge attack incredible destructive 
power. Although as an herbivore it lacks ferocity,
Ankylomon displays a brave nature nevertheless. It 
uses its special move Tail Hammer to ferociously 
beat the enemy with the iron ball on the tip of its 
tail. Any Digimon hit by this technique has its entire
skeleton (or wireframe) utterly obliterated."
"digimon_0720_profile","A Beast Man Digimon DNA Digivolved from Aquilamon
and Gatomon. Silphymon has tremendously strong
legs, and is said to be able to leap high into the sky.
Upon reaching these heights, it then spreads its arms
and sails through the air like a glider. Silphymon uses
the radar devices on its ears to gather information,
then visually processes this data for viewing on its
head-mounted display, allowing it to pinpoint an
enemy's location, day or night. It uses its special move
Top Gun to extend its arms to fire an energy bomb."
"digimon_0723_profile","A Mutant Digimon DNA Digivolved from Ankylomon 
and Angemon. Shakkoumon has a shiny silver body 
with white wings, and according to one theory, it's
actually an Angel Digimon that descended from on 
high into the Ancient Digital World. Since it can
rotate its head and torso a full 360 degrees, it's 
capable of attacking in any direction. Some people 
find it frightening because its lack of expression 
makes it impossible to tell what it's thinking, but it 
has a warm and gentle personality. Its special move 
Disaster Blaster shoots destructive red laser beams 
from its eyes. These lasers are said to reach 
temperatures of over 180,000 degrees Fahrenheit
at their focal point."
"digimon_0728_profile","A rare species of mechanical Machine Digimon.
Some researchers believe Solarmon to be a mutation
of Hagurumon, but the truth of the matter remains a
mystery. Because its DigiCore generates heat, its body
is hot enough to cause burns. Solarmon uses its special
move Shiny Ring to throw heat-emitting gears that scorch
the enemy."
"digimon_0729_profile","A Mollusk Digimon of the same species as Numemon. 
Geremon lacks attack power but is unusually ferocious,
rushing at the opponent no matter who they are.
As expected, this obstinate creature gets taken out
quickly, but then immediately forgets about its
defeats. For this reason, it picks fights with formidable
foes over and over again. Geremon uses its special
move Hyper Smell to secrete a violent stench from its
body."
"digimon_0730_profile","A Dark Angel Digimon with a heart as cold as ice. 
This is the form that a Devimon with the cruelest

"digimon_0750_profile","Lopmon is the Rookie Digivolution of one sibling
in a pair of extremely rare twin Digimon. Of the
two, Terriermon has one horn growing from its
head, while Lopmon has three. Their ecosystem is
steeped in mystery, and while their composition
is enough to deem them Beast Digimon, nothing
else is known about them. Terriermon has a
laid-back personality, albeit with a lot of energy,
while Lopmon has the opposite disposition, being
more of a lonely crybaby. Neither seem like
Digimon of the Combat Species, but they do show
unexpected power in battle. Lopmon's special
move Blazing Ice fires a blast of icy bullets."

Digital World of Witchelny. Sorcermon uses the magics

which it summons storm clouds from a wand topped
with crystallized ice in order to cause a massive blizzard."
"digimon_0758_profile","A Digimon with a body made of ice. Icemon's origins

Its special move Iceball Bomb involves throwing
ice-cold frozen bombs at foes."
"digimon_0759_profile","A Digimon composed almost entirely of earth data. 
MudFrigimon is thought to be a mutant born from
a mutation of Frigimon. It's friendly by nature and
dislikes fighting, but when the chips are down, it
can demonstrate rarely-seen power. It uses its
special move Great Weight to put all of its weight
behind a haymaker punch."
"digimon_0760_profile","Guarding a Chrondigizoit mine, Guardromon 
transformed itself to withstand merciless repeated 
raids by illegal miners. Guardromon (Gold)'s armor 
is said to be the result of taking in Chrondigizoit
dust data floating in the air. This armor is more 
durable than a normal Guardromon's, and its 
special move Destruction Grenade succeeds in
boasting slightly more output. On the other hand, 
Guardromon (Gold)'s armor is heavier, and this is 
the primary reason why its movements have dulled
