"digimon_0143_profile","Profile for Agumon (Black)"
that has developed the ability to walk
on two legs. Since it hasn't fully matured
it still lacks strength, but its fierce
disposition makes it reckless. Hard
sharp claws grow from its hands and feet
and it makes full use of them in battle.
This Digimon shows much potential
promising Digivolution into a great
and powerful Digimon. Its special
move is Spitfire Blast.
digimon_0175_profile,The Virus version of WarGreymon,
known and feared as the "Jet-Black
Dragon Warrior." Despite being
opposed to the values and beliefs
of the Virus Buster WarGreymon
BlackWarGreymon is devoted to its own
form of justice. Loathing cruelty
and deceit, it looks down on Digimon
it considers dishonorable—including
fellow Virus-attribute types. How it
became a Virus is a mystery, and it's
worth noting that the "Brave Shield"
on its back lacks the Crest of Courage.
Its special move Dark Terra Force
though similar to WarGreymon's
Terra Force, gathers all the negative
emotions in the world and concentrates
them into a single point before firing.
digimon_0182_profile,MetalGarurumon (Black) is a
Virus-attribute MetalGarurumon
equipped with freeze weapons all
over its body. It has a terrifying
personality, and when the laser sights
in its nose pick up a target, it chases
it down relentlessly without regard
to whether it's friend or foe before
blasting it with missiles. Its special
moves include Garuru Tomahawk
which fires a huge missile called
the Freeze Bomber from its chest
and Ice Wolf Claw, which fires all
the weapons on its body at once
to wipe out its foes.
digimon_0327_profile,The ultimate Android Digimon with
more than half of its body mechanized.
MetalGreymon (Virus) has braved
countless battles, only surviving
due to the mechanization of its body.
To successfully Digivolve into
MetalGreymon (Virus), a Greymon must
face several mighty foes and defeat them
in battle. Its attack power is said to
be as powerful as a nuclear warhead.
MetalGreymon (Virus) fires bionic
missiles from a hatch that opens in its chest.
digimon_0712_profile,Greymon (Blue) is the Virus-attribute type of
Greymon, with a black and blue body. Fiercer than
Greymon, it's often referred to as a completely wild
member of the species, but it's no lone wolf. It's
cunning enough to work together with allies to
achieve its goals.
digimon_0713_profile,A Gabumon that Digivolved into a Virus Digimon.
Gabumon (Black)'s pelt appears to be made from
data it collected from Virus-attribute Garurumon.
Gabumon (Black) can be wild and unruly, but it turns
shy and timid if its pelt is removed. Thus, its true
appearance remains a mystery.
digimon_0714_profile,A Virus Garurumon. The blades that extend from its
shoulders are so sharp that they can sever anything
they touch. Garurumon (Black) loves burying bones
in the ground, but the mischievous Drimogemon
enjoys moving them in secret.
digimon_0715_profile,A Digimon that Digivolved from a Virus-attribute
Garurumon. WereGarurumon (Black) is slower due
to its bipedal nature, but it makes up for this by
delivering powerful blows with its arms.
